		<h4>About Roses In The Ocean</h4>

    <section2>
      <div class= "section2">Roses in the Ocean was created when a young Australian chose to end his life on August 31st 2008. The 43 years old man was an ex RAAF Fighter Pilot Combat Instructor and International Commercial Pilot. He was highly respected, and loved by so many.  With all the medical, scientific and technological advances of the 21st century, we understand little of what causes such tragedy to occur or how to treat it…<br>
      It is said that 2191 people took their life in 2008 in Australia and Mark was Saturday one of them. The name roses in the ocean came about when Bronwyn and her family had gathering in Mark's name at his favourite beach in his home town, Coolum Beach, where they laid roses in the ocean a couple of weeks after his funeral. On this day Bronwyn and the husband made the time to open up about why their uncle had passed away.</p>

        The family made an important note to the children for them to understand that because you are going through hardships in life it does not mean you would die or have to die. And that we have to make it understood widely that it is okay to reach out and ask for help when you are in need of it. Now that roses in the ocean is a lead organisation for people have lived through these suicidal experiences in Australia we are focused on developing a workshop with a safe environment and trained people in these areas so that we can bring people who have suffered or are suffering into the healing process and change their lives, to prevent suicide from occurring. These workshops of a range of exercises and training opportunities for people who are suffering or have been through a traumatic experience with suicide. They are designed to empower people who are in need   and engage meaningful suicide prevention activities in their practice daily so they can live a long and happy life ahead of them.
       <br>
       We offer Community awareness events and intervention workshops that are aimed at increasing suicide as a topic that is not shunned any more but looked at with open arms. We aim to connect people with local service providers.
